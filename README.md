# zomato_sentimental_analysis
I have taken a training dataset of 108 rows with the reviews of the customers of different restaurants from zomato. I have worked upon the sentiment analysis of the customer's reviews. I have used the ML model similar to twitter sentiment analysis for the training from the kaggle and tested the zomato reviews on it but that gave me poor results then I have manually created the dataset for restaurant and differentiated the Good (0) & Bad (1) reviews for the training dataset and then tested that data on the other restaurants giving me a good results.
